libretro-pan
============

The libretro-pan project aims to ensure libretro frontends exist in all languages anyone cares about.

A language is considered covered once a tool written in this language can load Super Mario World with an unmodified Snes9X core, with both audio and video enabled, and any form of input, on any device.
If a language is covered by an external project, libretro-pan has no interest in making another one. Our goal is their existence, not being covered by us.
